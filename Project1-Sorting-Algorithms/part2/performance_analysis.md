# Performance Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

## Theoretical Time Complexities

| Algorithm       | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Quick Sort     | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n²)      | O(log n)         |
| Merge Sort     | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(n)             |
| Heap Sort      | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |
