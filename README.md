My name is Ju Ho Kim.
I'll update my coursework here repo this semester (CS 034 - Spring 2025).

## Projects

### Project 1: Sorting Algorithms
Implementation and analysis of various sorting algorithms including Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort.

## Labs

### Lab 7: Implementing Stacks and Queues
Implementation of Stack and Queue data structures for a ticketing service company.

#### Features:
- Stack implementation using linked list for ticket cancellation management
- Queue implementation using array for customer service call handling
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- Dynamic array resizing for the Queue implementation
- Detailed examples demonstrating LIFO and FIFO behavior

### Lab 9: Implementing Trees
Implementation of binary trees with various traversal methods and operations.

#### Features:
- Binary tree implementation with Node class
- Recursive traversal methods: preorder, inorder, and postorder
- Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert, search, and remove operations
- AVL Tree implementation with self-balancing capabilities (Extra Credit)
- Comprehensive testing of all tree operations

### Lab 10: Balanced Trees
Implementation of self-balancing binary search trees
  - AVL Tree with automatic balancing via rotations
  - Red-Black Tree with color-based balancing

#### Features:**
  - Binary tree implementation with Node class
  - AVL Tree with height-based balancing
  - Red-Black Tree with color property balancing
  - Tree visualization and traversal methods
  - Performance comparison between tree types
