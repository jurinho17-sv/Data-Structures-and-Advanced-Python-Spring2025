# Data-Structures-and-Advanced-Python-Spring2025

My name is Ju Ho Kim, one of the CS 034 students (Spring 2025). 
I'll update my coursework here repo this semester.
This repo is going to be about implementation of various data structures and algorithms using Python (Spring 2025 course projects)

## Projects

### Project 1: Sorting Algorithms
Implementation and analysis of various sorting algorithms including Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort.

## Labs

### Lab 7: Implementing Stacks and Queues
Implementation of Stack and Queue data structures for a ticketing service company.

#### Features:
- Stack implementation using linked list for ticket cancellation management
- Queue implementation using array for customer service call handling
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- Dynamic array resizing for the Queue implementation
- Detailed examples demonstrating LIFO and FIFO behavior

### Lab 9: Implementing Trees
Implementation of binary trees with various traversal methods and operations.

#### Features:
- Binary tree implementation with Node class
- Recursive traversal methods: preorder, inorder, and postorder
- Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert, search, and remove operations
- AVL Tree implementation with self-balancing capabilities (Extra Credit)
- Comprehensive testing of all tree operations
