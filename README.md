# Data-Structures-and-Advanced-Python-Spring2025

My name is Ju Ho Kim.
I'll update my coursework in this repo (CS 034 - Spring 2025).

## Projects

### Project 1: Sorting Algorithms
Implementation and analysis of various sorting algorithms including Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort.

### Project 3: Smart Delivery Route Planner
Implementation of a logistics route optimization system using graph algorithms for efficient delivery planning.

#### Features:
- Graph construction from CSV road network data
- Route connectivity checking using Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Shortest path calculation using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Optimal delivery route planning with greedy nearest-neighbor heuristic
- Interactive command-line interface for route planning

## Labs

### Lab 7: Implementing Stacks and Queues
Implementation of Stack and Queue data structures for a ticketing service company.

#### Features:
- Stack implementation using linked list for ticket cancellation management
- Queue implementation using array for customer service call handling
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- Dynamic array resizing for the Queue implementation
- Detailed examples demonstrating LIFO and FIFO behavior

### Lab 9: Implementing Trees
Implementation of binary trees with various traversal methods and operations.

#### Features:
- Binary tree implementation with Node class
- Recursive traversal methods: preorder, inorder, and postorder
- Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert, search, and remove operations
- AVL Tree implementation with self-balancing capabilities (Extra Credit)
- Comprehensive testing of all tree operations

### Lab 10: Balanced Trees
Implementation of self-balancing binary search trees
  - AVL Tree with automatic balancing via rotations
  - Red-Black Tree with color-based balancing

#### Features:
  - Binary tree implementation with Node class
  - AVL Tree with height-based balancing
  - Red-Black Tree with color property balancing

### Lab 11: Heaps and Treaps
Implementation of Binary Min-Heap and Treap data structures with testing and documentation.

#### Features:
- Binary Min-Heap implementation using Python's heapq module
- Treap implementation combining BST properties with heap priorities
- Automatic balancing through randomized priorities and rotations
- Comprehensive test suite demonstrating heap and treap operations
- Detailed design document with pseudocode and data representations

### Lab 12: Implementing and Applying the Set ADT
Implementation of a custom Set abstract data type and its application to a Course Enrollment Manager.

#### Features:
- Custom `Set` class implementation using Python dictionaries
- Set operations: add, remove, contains, union, intersection, difference
- `EnrollmentManager` application for tracking student course enrollments
- CSV file parsing for course roster management
- Comprehensive unit testing with 15 test cases
- Analysis of student enrollment patterns across courses

### Lab 15: B-Trees (The last one for this semester. Ty!!)
Implementation of a 2-3-4 Tree (B-Tree) data structure from scratch with core functionalities and balancing logic.

#### Features:
- 2-3-4 Tree implementation with dynamic node splitting
- Support for up to 3 keys per node and 2-4 children
- Core operations: insert, contains, and in-order traversal
- Automatic tree balancing through node splitting
- Bonus: remove operation and visual tree printing
- Comprehensive test driver with 15-20 random integers
